This repository contains slides and python notebooks for the [DataTalks.club](https://datatalks.club) event [Introduction to Bayesian Inference for Parameter Estimation](https://www.eventbrite.de/e/introduction-to-bayesian-inference-for-parameter-estimation-tickets-465452690527)

Additional Resources:
- Online Book: [Bayesian Methods for Hackers](https://camdavidsonpilon.github.io/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers/) is a great place to start for any looking for a accessible, pragmatic introduction to the subject. The book is designed as a series of python notebooks.
- Online Course: [Statistical Rethinking](https://github.com/rmcelreath/stat_rethinking_2022) is one the best courses to go deeper into the subject
- Book: [BDA3](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/). Bayesian Data Analysis by Andrew Gelman is the Bible of bayesian analysis. After you finish the Statistical Rethinking course and you still want more, this would be the next step
